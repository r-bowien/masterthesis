	abstract = {The recent rise of populist politicians in Western democracies is often associated with their allegedly successful use of digital media. However, for a long time, there has been little research specifically on populist online communication. To address this substantial research gap, the thesis pursues two major research aims: First, it investigates drivers of populist communication in politicians’ online self-presentation and online news media representation. Second, the thesis examines the effects of populist online communication on citizens’ behavior in the form of user reactions to politicians’ social media posts and reader comments on online news articles. Based on five internationally comparative studies and the overarching synopsis, the cumulative thesis demonstrates that populist online communication is driven by the reciprocal interactions among politicians, journalists, and citizens and is influenced by various factors on the macro, meso, and micro level. Furthermore, it shows that populist online communication resonates with citizens and is multiplied by them – specifically by citizens with prior strong populist attitudes. By analyzing the interactions of three key actor groups – politicians, journalists, and citizens – and by following a multimethod approach the dissertation connects research on both the supply and demand side of populism.},

It employs a cross-lagged design to investigate the extent to which common forms of online activity create pathways to online and offline forms of political activity. Specifically, we examine the influence of Friendship-Driven (FD) and Interest-Driven (ID) online activity on online participatory politics and on offline forms of political action. Our findings reveal that FD and ID activity relate to political engagement, but in different ways. In addition, we find that the size of young people’s social networks interacts with both FD and ID online activity to promote political activity. This indicates that having exposure to “weak-ties” (resulting from large social networks) promote higher levels of political engagement. These findings demonstrate the need to specify the kinds of online activities in which youth are engaged and, more broadly, the political significance of social media and social networks},

	abstract = {In recent years, social media are said to have an impact on the public discourse and communication in the society. In particular, social media are increasingly used in political context. More recently, microblogging services (e.g., Twitter) and social network sites (e.g., Facebook) are believed to have the potential for increasing political participation. While Twitter is an ideal platform for users to spread not only information in general but also political opinions publicly through their networks, political institutions (e.g., politicians, political parties, political foundations, etc.) have also begun to use Facebook pages or groups for the purpose of entering into direct dialogs with citizens and encouraging more political discussions. Previous studies have shown that from the perspective of political institutions, there is an emerging need to continuously collect, monitor, analyze, summarize, and visualize politically relevant information from social media. These activities, which are subsumed under “social media analytics,” are considered difficult tasks due to a large numbers of different social media platforms as well as the large amount and complexity of information and data. Systematic tracking and analysis approaches along with appropriate scientific methods and techniques in political domain are still lacking. In this paper, we propose a methodological framework for social media analytics in political context. More specifically, our framework summarizes most important politically relevant issues from the perspective of political institutions and corresponding methodologies from different scientific disciplines.},

With the rapid proliferation of meme culture across platforms such as Twitter (X), Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook, memes have emerged as potent tools for political communication, serving as vehicles for political expression and instruments for reinforcing ideological divides. By analyzing political memes’ circulation, engagement, and sentiment, this study reveals how memes predominantly circulate within political echo chambers, fostering increased engagement within ideologically homogenous groups while limiting exposure to opposing viewpoints. Additionally, the emotional resonance of memes and their viral potential contribute significantly to their effectiveness in influencing political opinions and mobilizing support for political movements. However, the study also highlights concerns regarding the spread of misinformation and the role of memes in exacerbating political polarization. The findings suggest that memes facilitate political participation and awareness and challenge democratic discourse by amplifying divisiveness. The article calls for further research into the long-term effects of meme-driven political communication on voter behavior, civic engagement, and democratic processes.},

Does it highlight corruption, inequality, or climate change through a particular lens (e.g., irony, sarcasm, humor)? The analysis is framed by categorizing memes based on their political message (e.g., pro- or anti-candidate, issue-based memes, satire, humor). After that, common themes are identified (i.e., division, mobilization, social justice, and disinformation).”

Results reveal that sharing political memes is a form of political expression employed by a variety of people in the United States, including political moderates and people both politically interested and noninterested. The data suggest that people who circulate political memes are motivated to make fun of politicians, but also to persuade and inform others in some cases. Results also highlight potential consequences of exposure to political memes, such as heightened online opinion expression, political participation, and anger toward the opposing presidential candidate.

We analyse the relationship between organisational logics and memes as a genre characterised by participation.

We identify three styles of memetic content created by political parties and partisans: professional, generic, and participatory. We argue that these different kinds of meme each relate to particular organisational logics, with the hierarchical structures of professional election campaigns largely hollowing out the participatory potential of internet memes in both production and form.},

mixed methods:
quantitative content analysis for salience and thematic focus of the memes: what memes are used for.
critical visual analyis for aesthetic of a subsample of the memes, to explore how their production and circulation relates to the particular communicative and participatory imperatives of the campaign.


classify 3 different styles of memes:


professional


higher scoring in production value and visuals




generic


the more generic, the less subcultural knowledge is required to understand the meme




participatory


the more participatory, the more subcultural knowledge required






supplemented by “semi-structured interviews with meme creators working either with one of the parties’ digital communications team during the 2022 election campaign, or alternatively, administrating a partisan meme space not formally affiliated with a party”

findings:


less than 15\% of images posted by political parties in Australia during campaigning were memes.


memes are primarily used for visual attack ads or negative campaigning

In the highly anticipated Fourth Edition, award-winning scholar and author Klaus Krippendorff introduces you to the most current method of analyzing the textual fabric of contemporary society. Students and scholars will learn to treat data not as physical events but as communications that are created and disseminated to be seen, read, interpreted, enacted, and reflected upon according to the meanings they have for their recipients. Interpreting communications as texts in the contexts of their social uses distinguishes content analysis from other empirical methods of inquiry. Organized into three parts, Content Analysis first examines the conceptual aspects of content analysis, then discusses components such as unitizing and sampling, and concludes by showing readers how to trace the analytical paths and apply evaluative techniques. The Fourth Edition has been completely revised to offer you the most current techniques and research on content analysis, including new information on reliability and social media. You will also gain practical advice and experience for teaching academic and commercial researchers how to conduct content analysis.},

The present study focuses on another part of the hybrid media system and explores how politicians in four countries (AT, CH, IT, UK) use Facebook and Twitter for populist purposes. Five key elements of populism are derived from the literature: emphasizing the sovereignty of the people, advocating for the people, attacking the elite, ostracizing others, and invoking the ‘heartland’. A qualitative text analysis reveals that populism manifests itself in a fragmented form on social media. Populist statements can be found across countries, parties, and politicians’ status levels. While a broad range of politicians advocate for the people, attacks on the economic elite are preferred by left-wing populists. Attacks on the media elite and ostracism of others, however, are predominantly conducted by right-wing speakers. Overall, the paper provides an in-depth analysis of populism on social media. It shows that social media give the populist actors the freedom to articulate their ideology and spread their messages.
